# Cingle

## Summary

A reproduction of basic functionality of java-based "jingle" (specifically, eye measuring), but in C (with Linux focus).

Currently only supporting X11 environments in Linux (tested under Debian).

## Usage

`setup.sh` should bring in the necessary libraries for apt-based distros

`build.sh` will build the project into the executable `cingle` file
